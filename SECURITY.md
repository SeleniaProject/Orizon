# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively maintain and provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.1   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Orizon team takes security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

### How to Report

**Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please send an email to: **security@orizon-lang.org**

Include the following information:
- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### Response Timeline

- **24 hours**: Acknowledgment of your report
- **7 days**: Initial assessment and severity classification
- **30 days**: Fix development and testing (for high/critical issues)
- **60 days**: Public disclosure coordination

### Security Process

1. **Report received**: We acknowledge receipt within 24 hours
2. **Initial triage**: We assess the report within 7 days
3. **Investigation**: We investigate and develop a fix
4. **Fix validation**: We test the fix thoroughly
5. **Coordinated disclosure**: We work with you on public disclosure timing
6. **Public disclosure**: We publish advisories and release fixes

## Security Considerations

### Compiler Security

The Orizon compiler processes untrusted input (source code) and must be secure against:

- **Denial of Service**: Malformed input causing infinite loops or excessive memory usage
- **Code Injection**: Malicious input affecting code generation
- **Information Disclosure**: Compiler revealing sensitive information
- **Memory Safety**: Buffer overflows, use-after-free, etc.

### Language Security

Orizon aims to be a secure-by-default language:

- **Memory Safety**: Preventing buffer overflows, use-after-free, etc.
- **Type Safety**: Preventing type confusion attacks
- **Concurrency Safety**: Preventing data races and similar issues
- **Integer Safety**: Preventing integer overflow vulnerabilities

### Supply Chain Security

We implement measures to ensure supply chain security:

- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular security scans of dependencies
- **Reproducible Builds**: Builds that can be verified independently
- **Signed Releases**: All releases are cryptographically signed
- **Minimal Dependencies**: We minimize external dependencies

## Security Features

### Implemented

- **Memory Safe Parser**: Hand-written parser with bounds checking
- **Fuzzing**: Continuous fuzzing of compiler components
- **Safe Defaults**: Secure default configurations
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input validation and sanitization

### Planned

- **Code Signing**: Binary signing for all releases
- **SLSA Compliance**: Supply chain security compliance
- **Security Audits**: Regular third-party security audits
- **Sandboxing**: Compiler sandboxing for untrusted code

## Vulnerability Classes

### High Priority

- **Remote Code Execution**: Any RCE vulnerability in compiler or runtime
- **Memory Corruption**: Buffer overflows, use-after-free, etc.
- **Compiler Crashes**: DoS through malformed input
- **Information Disclosure**: Leaking sensitive information

### Medium Priority

- **Input Validation**: Insufficient validation of user input
- **Denial of Service**: Non-crash DoS (excessive resource usage)
- **Logic Bugs**: Incorrect behavior that could lead to security issues

### Low Priority

- **Documentation Issues**: Misleading security-related documentation
- **Configuration Issues**: Insecure default configurations
- **Timing Attacks**: Side-channel attacks (unless practically exploitable)

## Security Resources

- **Security Email**: security@orizon-lang.org
- **PGP Key**: [Coming Soon]
- **Security Advisories**: [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/SeleniaProject/Orizon/security/advisories)
- **CVE Database**: [CVE Program](https://cve.mitre.org/)

## Recognition

We believe in recognizing security researchers who help make Orizon more secure:

- **Hall of Fame**: Recognition on our website and documentation
- **Acknowledgments**: Credit in security advisories and release notes
- **Swag**: Orizon merchandise for significant findings
- **Bounties**: Bug bounty program (planned for 1.0 release)

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

- **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest stable version
- **Validate Input**: Validate all untrusted input in your Orizon programs
- **Follow Guides**: Follow our security guidelines and best practices
- **Report Issues**: Report any security concerns promptly

### For Contributors

- **Security Reviews**: All code changes undergo security review
- **Testing**: Include security tests with new features
- **Documentation**: Document security implications of changes
- **Training**: Participate in security training and education

## Legal

This security policy is subject to our standard [Terms of Service](https://orizon-lang.org/terms) and [Privacy Policy](https://orizon-lang.org/privacy).

Reports made in good faith under this policy will not result in legal action against the reporter.
