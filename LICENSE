# License

This project is dual-licensed under your choice of:

- **MIT License** ([LICENSE-MIT](LICENSE-MIT))
- **Apache License, Version 2.0** ([LICENSE-APACHE](LICENSE-APACHE))

Unless you explicitly state otherwise, any contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in Orizon by you, as defined in the Apache-2.0 license, shall be dual licensed as above, without any additional terms or conditions.

## Why Dual License?

We chose dual licensing to provide maximum compatibility and flexibility:

- **MIT License**: Simple and permissive, compatible with virtually all other licenses
- **Apache License 2.0**: Provides explicit patent protection and contributor protections

## Usage Guidelines

- **Open Source Projects**: Choose either license based on your project's requirements
- **Commercial Use**: Both licenses permit commercial use without restrictions
- **Patent Concerns**: Apache 2.0 provides better patent protection
- **Simplicity**: MIT is shorter and simpler if patents aren't a concern

## Contributors

By contributing to this project, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under both licenses.
